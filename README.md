1. What is Version Control Application (VCA)?
	is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, 
	large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes 
	are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the 
	"revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision".

2. What are the examples of Version Control Application?

3. What are the two types of VCA, and give examples each?

4. What is Git?
	- is a version control system that is widely used for 
	software development and other version control tasks. It is a 
	distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, 
	data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
   Who invented or developed Git?
	- Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of 
	the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to 
	its initial development.

5. What is Github?
	-  is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all 
	of the distributed revision control and source code management 
	(SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
	Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub 
	provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as 
	mobile integration. It also provides access control and several 
	collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, 
	task management, and wikis for every project.

6. Definition of Terms
	Repository - a repository can be a place where multiple databases 
		or files are located for distribution over a network, or a 
		repository can be a location that is directly accessible to 
		the user without having to travel across a network.
	Commit - 
	Pull/Pulling
	Fork/Forking - happens when developers take a copy of source code 
		from one software package and start independent development on it, 
		creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies 
		not merely a development branch, but a split in the developer community, 
		a form of schism.
	Push/Pushing
	Bridge
